"    <p>\n"
"    You can create as many Feeds importer configurations as you would "
"like to. Each can have a distinct purpose like letting your users "
"aggregate RSS feeds or importing a CSV file for content migration. "
"Here are a couple of things that are important to understand in order "
"to get started with Feeds:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Every importer configuration consists of basic settings, a "
"fetcher, a parser and a processor and their settings.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    The <strong>basic settings</strong> define the general behavior of "
"the importer. <strong>Fetchers</strong> are responsible for loading "
"data, <strong>parsers</strong> for organizing it and "
"<strong>processors</strong> for \"doing stuff\" with it, usually "
"storing it.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    In Basic settings, you can <strong>attach an importer "
"configuration to a content type</strong>. This is useful when many "
"imports of a kind should be created, for example in an RSS aggregation "
"scenario. If you don't attach a configuration to a content type, you "
"can use it on the !import page.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Imports can be <strong>scheduled periodically</strong> - see the "
"periodic import select box in the Basic settings.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Processors can have <strong>mappings</strong> in addition to "
"settings. Mappings allow you to define what elements of a data feed "
"should be mapped to what content fields on a granular level. For "
"instance, you can specify that a feed item's author should be mapped "
"to a node's body.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    "

" \\n"
"Transparente und nachvollziehbare Verfahrensabläufe verleihen dem "
"politischen Prozess und dessen Ergebnissen Legitimität und sind daher "
"von größter Wichtigkeit. Zu diesen transparenten Verfahrensabläufen "
"gehört auch das Recht auf den Zugang zu Dokumenten, wie es bereits "
"seit dem Vertrag von Amsterdam auf Ebene der Europäischen Verträge "
"verbrieft ist.\\n"
" \\n"
"Eine Einschränkung dieses Rechts ist aus guten Gründen nur in "
"wenigen Ausnahmefällen, nämlich wenn andere hochrangige Rechtsgüter "
"berührt sind, möglich. Leider zeigt Ihr Fall, dass gerade die "
"Europäische Kommission ihren Verpflichtungen auf diesem wichtigen "
"Feld nicht immer ausreichend nachkommt. Dies halte ich für sehr "
"bedauerlich. Gerade die Möglichkeit der Institutionen, die Anfrage de "
"facto auf unbestimmte Zeit aufschieben zu können, halte ich für "
"problematisch, zeigt sich darin doch eine regulatorische Lücke, die "
"die Europäische Kommission zum Nachteil des Petenten geschickt zu "
"nutzen weiß. \\n"

"haben Sie vielen Dank für Ihre Zuschrift. Ungarn ist für uns ein "
"wichtiger Partner in Europa und wir verfolgen die Entwicklung im Land "
"stets mit großer Aufmerksamkeit. Deshalb haben wir auch vor einigen "
"Monaten unseren ungarischen Kollegen kritische Fragen zur Situation "
"gestellt. Wir haben wie auch die Europäische Kommission die "
"politischen Geschehnisse genau beobachtet und sind davon überzeugt, "
"dass die ungarische Regierung unter Viktor Orban die "
"Gesetzesänderungen mit den europäischen Grundrechten in Einklang "
"bringt. Die von der Europäischen Kommission geforderten Änderungen "
"hat die ungarische Regierung umgesetzt und sich an die EU-Regeln "
"gehalten. \\n"
"\\n"
"Wir arbeiten in der EVP-Fraktion sehr gut und vertrauensvoll mit den "
"ungarischen Fidesz-Abgeordneten zusammen. Die Kollegen sind sehr "
"engagierte Europäer. Generell halte ich es immer für klüger, die "
"Gesprächskanäle offen zu halten und Probleme offen und ehrlich "
"anzusprechen um Missverständnisse aus dem Weg zu räumen. Ich denke, "
"wir haben einen besseren Einblick in die Geschehnisse und können im "
"Zweifelsfall korrigierend einwirken, wenn wir im Gespräch mit Fidesz "
"und der ungarischen Regierung bleiben. \\n"
"\\n"
"Ich hoffe, ich konnte damit Ihre Bedenken aus dem Weg räumen.\\n"
